# Fire-protection-electrical-installations

This work describes the types of fire protection, as well as the ways of its implementation. In order 
to understand the main goal of the work, the theoretical foundations of fire as well as its dangers are 
described. After explaining the types of fire protection systems, we describe the main parts of the 
fire protection system and their purpose. In order for fire protection to carry out its task, the rules 
for placing elements of fire protection are described. Given that after the occurrence of a fire in 
some situations there may be a loss of electricity supply, an important topic is the power supply of 
both the building itself and the elements of fire protection.
